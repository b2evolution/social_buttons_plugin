### Notes:

* The cached mode uses RenderItemAsHtml function for performance reasons.In case your changes does not take effect, hit Admin > Tools > Delete pre-rendered item cache.
* The plugin uses &quot;stealth&quot; mode, which means the plugin is enabled and you dont have a choice to enable/disable on a per post basis. If you would like to do that, switch it to "opt-out" or "opt-in".
